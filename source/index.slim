    h2 About CivicSpaces

    div.col32
      p CivicSpaces is a site to help active citizens, artists and nonprofits find unused spaces to host their events and display their creative work. We serve as a conduit, connecting owners of empty spaces with people who want to fill them for a short-term project, event or activity. 

      p Building owners who have vacant storefronts, office space or even empty lots can offer their space through CivicSpaces to attract artists and nonprofits to fill them with life for a short period of time. There are many studies showing that active spaces are more attractive and easier to rent than empty ones. Having active offices and storefronts can lead to more foot traffic, increasing an areas visibility and reducing crime. 

      p We want to keep our city vibrant, one empty space at a time.

    h2 Citizens

    div.col32
      p Individuals and organizations like you constantly need space to grow ideas. Office space to work in. Event space for fundraisers. A vacant lot to grow food on.  CivicSpaces can pair you with empty properties around Atlanta. We allow you to find properties that fit your needs- location, size and use- and best of all that fit your budget. Our participating spaces are primarily free although some costs and deposits may be required. Search our database, find a property that matches your needs and connect! 

      h3 Who Qualifies?
      p This really depends on the space. Most of our spaces and events welcome anyone with a good idea to fill a vacant storefront, office or empty lot. This can mean artists, community organizations or any citizen who has a vested interest in making Atlanta’s vacant spaces look more appealing. Some spaces may only allow organizations or people affiliated with an official 501c3 IRS designated group use their space. There are many reasons for this but a major one may be the wish of the hosting space to receive a tax deduction in exchange for space use.  

      p We are happy to work with anyone who wishes to fill a vacant space and can help you find the right location for your idea. In addition we can provide sound consulting services to help your organization decide on the type and even design of your event or project. Not sure how your organization can use an empty space or benefit from our programs? Contact us and we will be glad to speak with you about it.

      h3 What events and activities do you promote? 
      p CivicSpaces encourages groups and active citizens to fill our city’s vacant spaces with creative events and displays. This includes:

      ul
        li gallery-style installations 
        li sculptures
        li human interest displays (like informative displays around local or regional issues, nonprofit sponsored art or photography displays, graphics or charts informing citizens)

      h3 What You Should Know
      p 
        | Currently CivicSpaces only provides you information about what spaces are willing to participate in a civic activity. We do not book spaces, arrange contracts or take on any responsibility for the space-to-citizen transaction. If you find a space and want to host an event or installation it is up to you to work out details with the space owner through the listed contact information on our site. We have provided a 
        a(href="/resources") list of resources and materials 
        |  to help you navigate hosting an event or activity in a vacant space. These materials are only meant to be helpful resources and are not a guarantee of a successful or incident-free space to citizen interaction.
